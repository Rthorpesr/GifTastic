# GifTastic
Reggie's gifs of sports teams

Purpose: 
Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice.
I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

Instructions give to me:
1.) create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called topics.
2.) Chose ant theme (I chose sports teams). (some team names brought back some provacative gifs) (LOL!). These teams are not in the array.
3.) In the app I am to take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

How it the Sports GifTastic works.
1.) a call is made to the API for gifs from all the sport teams pre-loaded in my array (Hard-coded) in the program.
2.) If you click on a button with a team name, you will see a series of gifs that are of the team button selected.
3.) The gifs appear in a "STILL" state, but to animate the gif, click on it. The state changes to "Animate", clicking 
    on it again returns to gif back to "STILL".
4.) If the team you want to see gifs for teams who do not have a button, use the input box and click "add team". 
    Immediately, your team's button is added to the end of the "fard-coded" array and is displayed on the screen with 
    the other buttons and if clicked, gifs will appear cooreponding to the team you added.
    
 5.) This app was made responsive for cell-phones and small tablets.
